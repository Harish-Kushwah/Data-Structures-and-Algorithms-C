Table of Contents:
| Data Structures     | Description                                      | Branch |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------|
| Linked List         | A linear data structure where elements are stored as nodes with pointers to the next element. | [LinkedList](src/data_structures/linked_list.c) |
| Stack               | A data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. | [Stack](src/data_structures/stack.c) |
| Queue               | A data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. | [Queue](src/data_structures/queue.c) |
| Binary Search Tree  | A binary tree data structure with the property that the left child is less than the parent, and the right child is greater. | [Tree](src/data_structures/binary_search_tree.c) |
|Graph|Graphs are a fundamental data structure used to represent relationships between objects. They consist of vertices (nodes) connected by edges.|[Graph](src/)|

| Algorithms          | Description                                      | Code |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------|
| Binary Search       | A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. | [binary_search.c](src/algorithms/binary_search.c) |
| Bubble Sort         | A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. | [bubble_sort.c](src/algorithms/bubble_sort.c) |
| Merge Sort          | A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides the array and merges the sorted subarrays. | [merge_sort.c](src/algorithms/merge_sort.c) |
| Depth-First Search  | A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible before backtracking. | [dfs.c](src/algorithms/dfs.c) |
